#### Background:

Madrid's City Hall have introduced new restrictions on traffic in the heart of the capital. This measurement was aligned with the air quality strategy for reducing the high values of pollution were matched last years in the town.

#### Lifetime:
**30th nov 2018**: Started
**1st jul-30th sep 2019**: Right party, ciudadanos and vox want to apply a moratorium on sanctions  for citizens who enter in madrid
Only from 1-8th jul 2019: it was admitted that moratorium bc several greenparties and institurions pushed.
**Jul 2019**: Europe comission sentence Spain for: systematically violate "legal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits. Specially at Madrid, Barcelona y Vallès-Baix Llobregat.

#### Main points:
472 hectares of the city center off-limits to traffic
except for local residents and public transportatio
Non-residents with appropriate energy labels
exceptions are made for people with reduced mobility, ambulances, taxis, private-hire cars and delivery vans
Electric vehicles will also be allowed

#### Expectation:
will reduce emissions NOx by 30-40% as a result of eliminating through traffic and banning the biggest polluters from the area.
Even so, They only have one field station called “del Carmen” which measures air quality in the “zona restringida” among 24 stations around Madrid center. And after activating the restriction plan, Carmen's station got lower pollution values, even though the others stations continues increasing.
Although, the first three months of 2019 have been the worst, only after 2011 and 2012. And we only can compare from 2011 because in 2010 the location office the measurement stations was changed.
Moreover, Comparing the median of the first three months from 2011-2018 to confront the one in 2019 in terms of removing the meteorological factor, we conclude that 2019 is still above the median.
Looking at the adverse air quality situation in Madrid, we conduct a new visualization of tropospheric NO2 via spatial and temporal scale by analysing satellite images.
NO2 has been monitored by satellite since 1995 with GOME, since 2002 with SCIAMACHY, and since 2004 with the OMI instrument; the latter two instruments having the advantage of a high spatial resolution. As the last satellite, Sentinel 5p is in charged to monitor the atmosphere conditions Launched in October 2017.
This is an experiment aiming at giving more transparency to the Madrid’s citizens according pollution trends.

#### MARKETING

* Collaboration with “calida del aire comunidad de madrid”
* Collaboration with TRAFICO. They can show along highways how one produces pollution and how that influence in his or her neighborhood.
* Collaboration with a newspaper or all of them
* Collaboration with “universidad politecnica de madrid”
* Publish to twitter
* Principal responsible of mapping new european rights in meditarrean and associated with madrid central issue: @KarmenuVella
* European comissioner and related with madrid case: @MAC_europa

#### WORKFLOW
* Download vector layer (neightborhoods, buildings)
* Create Twitter 56eo and link to a broad fruitful network
* Download sahpefile of “zona restringida de trafico”
* GEE- extract NO2 or others or others

* vectorizing all the tiffs via google earth engine to lighten workload ?-Ideally all the work is done on the platform itself, otherwise manually at home-
Extract NO2 troposphere, not stratosphere, have a look pag 15-76 - TO KNOW
